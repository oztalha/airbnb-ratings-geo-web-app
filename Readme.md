# AirBnB Reputation Filter

Reviewing is a feedback mechanism that e-commerce sites leverage to help their customers make more informative purchase decisions on their platforms. Although the biggest online sellers such as Amazon and eBay allow their users to filter the search results by seller reputations, the leading space sharing platform AirBnB lacks this feature. In this project, I create a demo geo-web application that allows its users to filter and visualize AirBnB listings in Washington, D.C. by the hostsâ€™ reputation.
